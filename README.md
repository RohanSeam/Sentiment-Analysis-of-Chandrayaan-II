# Sentiment-Analysis-of-Chandrayaan-II

The goal of this project was to use Sentiment Analysis, also known as opinion-mining is a way of classifying text in terms of positive, negative and neutral sentiments. It is useful to a wide range of problems that are of interest to human-computer interaction practitioners and researchers, as well as those from fields such as sociology, marketing and advertising, psychology, economics, and political science. 

The project was an individual project that involved performing sentiment analysis on Twitter data using deep learning algorithms. The two deep learning algorithms included the Neural Bag-of-Words model (MCP) and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model on a Twitter dataset. 

The project was implemented using Python 3 and NumPy, NLTK for the natural language toolkit, Scikit-Learn for Machine Learning, and TensorFlow and Keras for Deep Learning.
